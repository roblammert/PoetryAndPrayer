# Workbench of the Forsaken
	
A warm cup of coffee in hand, I start my day  
I sit in front of my workbench ready to work  
All the unfinished projects are strewn about  
How did I ever let things get this way.  
  
A chair to be fixed with a long ago broken leg  
There's the side table that was supposed to be a gift  
Even a few long forgotten honey-do items  
And my list of 'want to get dones' hangs on a peg.  
  
Why have I left it all unfinished  
Some started, some waiting  
Others given upon on and left sitting  
Where else has my life diminished?  
  
Greed lays next to the saw  
With all of the false gods in my life  
I should cut off the dead of the dragon I'm chasing  
But it is so difficult being caught in its maw.  
  
Caught in the vise, gluttony and pride hold fast  
Why do I grip onto accolades and want of more  
Forcing all to see my needs and accomplishments  
What else in life should I have amassed?  
  
Hiding under the sander are envy & lust  
I should level out my thoughts of contentment  
Why am I not thankful for what I have?  
I fantasize and chase what I believe that I must.  
  
Sloth and wrath sit my the hammer & nail  
I am so hard & demanding of others and myself  
That missed expectations make me lose heart  
Then all of these projects sit or fail.  
  
What can I do, what tools should I use  
Where do I begin, what is next?  
I don't have a clue where i left off  
What if i give up and refuse?  
  
I sat down to start my day, not analyze my life  
Where have things gone so wrong  
How did I lose track of so many things  
Lord, please help me, I'm wrecked with strife.
