# The Call of a Friend

Covered in darkness,  
Shadowed from light,  
My brain is going in circles,  
I'm not worth the fight.  

This mind has been blinded,  
My thoughts are not my own.  
Why should I care?  
Do I have a heart of stone?  

Stuck under the covers,  
Hiding from the world in my bed,  
I can't hardly move my body,  
My muscles feel like lead.  

Curtains and doors hide me,  
From the world outside.  
My thoughts and my toils,  
Are eating me from the inside.  

On my soul you knock,  
As loud as if it were a door.  
But I can't answer you,  
Because I am powerless on the floor.  

A glimmer of sun shines through,  
Into the window, the wind blows.  
For the life of me I don't understand,  
For deaths sleep to awake, you have chose.  

I have been asleep,  
Letting the darkness settle in.  
You just won't let me wallow,  
The shadows can not be allowed to win.  

These hands have been tied,  
My body is covered in flies.  
Goodnight and goodbye I have said,  
But you awoke me, with one word, "Arise!"  

I stumble into the light,  
My life is not at its end.  
For you have awoken me,  
A miracle of Jesus, whom I call friend.
