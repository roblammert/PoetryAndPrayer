# Rob's Poetry And Prayer Repository

This is my place to store various writings of prayer and poetry so it is not lost. As my Catholic faith is very important to me, much of the works found here will be derived and inspired by the Holy Spirit.

No works here are meant to offend anyone. These are my feelings and thoughts and have no bearing on your rights or freedoms. These works are also written at the point that I understand my faith at the point at which they were written. This may not be perfect, canon, or 100% correct. They are a human's thoughts and interpretations of his faith at a point in time and can change or adapt over time as I continue down the journey of my faith.
