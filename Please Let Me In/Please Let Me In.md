# Please Let Me In
	
I pray that I'm not too late,  
You've shown me the errors in my life.  
I fight the ever present, near occasion of sin.  
Into heaven, please Lord, let me in.  

Graciously have mercy on me, a sinner,  
I have strayed time and time again.  
Through my faith I shout, "Get behind me Satan!"  
Into heaven, please Lord, let me in.  

Jesus, who gave his life for me,  
Watch over me and catch me when I fall.  
When I stray, demand to know where I've been.  
Into heaven, please Lord, let me in.  

Holy Spirit, the love of the Father and the Son,  
Heal my brokenness, show me the light.  
Don't leave me in the darkness of hell or purgatory's din,  
Into heaven, gracious Lord, please let me in!  

Amen.
