# The Path

Our lives lead us in many different ways.  
Whether it be in thought or deed,  
We follow our minds, not always our hearts,  
But who is it that plants the seed.  

Days of doubt, despair, and hopelessness  
Should bring us to our knees.  
Instead we struggle down a path  
We hope that no one else sees.  

These dark days may be few or many,  
The count of them we can not control.  
If we would only push away the devil,  
Jesus wants to save our broken soul.  

Letting in the light opens our eyes,  
But we may still not listen with our heart.  
Let me in, He says to those who are hardened,  
Why do you want to be apart?  

Your heart is meant to be saved,  
God created you to thrive.  
It is up to us to choose to walk,  
As a man, fully alive.  

Your chance is now, the fork in the road,  
To the left is despair, love is to the right.  
Give your heart and soul freely,  
For the open arms of Jesus await you, in light.
