# Drowning Pool

My young ears hear a strange man yelling at a crowd on the shore.  
I can't quite make out what he is saying, it seems to be some kind of lore.  
So I push my way forward in the crowd so that I can hear more.  
The man is talking about straightening paths to prepare for some lord.  
  
A few people around me begin entering the water, toward the man in a line.  
First a handful, then in groups, running like it was a breadline.  
What is this man selling, what brings people here to listen to his design.  
He is telling us we need to cleanse our souls. What does he know about mine?  
  
I join the group, following like lemmings, into water that is about chest height.  
Closer to the front, the stranger holds you underwater without fear, will no one fight?  
He speaks words that I don't understand, while I stand there in a fright.  
Whom he was holding under comes up and stumble back to shore, now I am in the man's sight.  
  
He waves me over and grabs my shoulders and says "Repent" as he looks me in the eye.  
I then get an uneasy feeling as he tips me back and until I am looking at the sky.  
Then I am under water, my arms are flailing from it being such a surprise.  
He holds me under the surface, I can't breathe. Will this be my demise?  
  
Am I drowning? Is he trying to kill me? My family will want me back!  
My vision is fading. I can feel myself letting go. Everything is turning black.  
I can feel my spirit begin to leave me. Why am I listening to this maniac.  
Then I'm jolted  above the surface. My breath comes back frantically, my lungs under attack.  
  
The stranger looks me in the eyes and he tells me my soul is clean.  
Sucking in air, I nod, and in his eyes I see a new glean.  
As I slog towards the shore, I ponder what can this mean?  
Sitting on the shore, I hold my head in my hands when I am hit with dopamine.  
  
This stranger didn't take my life, he saved it. I am such a fool!  
No longer does the darkness or my past demons make me their tool.  
What just happened? He removed the blackness from my soul, from Satan's rule.  
I left behind my sins and demons within this man's drowning pool.
