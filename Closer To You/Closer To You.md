# Closer To You

How can I be an agent of change?  
What words can I say?  
Can I meet someone where they are at,  
To bring them closer to you.  

How can I bring a soul to the light?  
What is it that I am missing?  
Can I open their eyes to love,  
To bring them closer to you.  

How can I open their eyes to joy?  
What is it I need to share your love?  
Can they feel your saving passion,  
To bring them closer to you.  

How can someone deny you?  
What is it that they don't hear?  
Can I open their eyes, ears, and heart,  
To bring them closer to you.  

How can I show love to them?  
What can I do to change their heart?  
Can I be an agent of change,  
To bring them closer to you.
