# Come Holy Spirit

Come Holy Spirit, lead me.  
Come Holy Spirit, heal me.  
Know my pain, my trials, and my brokenness.  

Come Holy Spirit, be my guide.  
Come Holy Spirit, be at my side.  
Grow my patience, my virtue, and my faith.  

Come Holy Spirit, save me from myself.  
Come Holy Spirit, bring me before thyself.  
Know my heart, my weakness, and my pleas.  

Come Holy Spirit, bring me grace.  
Come Holy Spirit, show me your face.  
Grow in me strength, love, and righteousness.   

Come Holy Spirit, call my name.  
Come Holy Spirit, let me never be the same.   
Know my sins, my regret, and my penance.  

Come into my heart, Holy Spirit;  
Show me forgiveness, witness, and joy.  
Bless me with humility, humanity, and peace.  

Amen.
