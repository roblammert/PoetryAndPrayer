# Tides
	
Rising and falling, pushing and pulling, the waters of the sea moves.  
Power greater than us decide the motion, the amounts, and the moods.  
Dependable and timely, ceaseless and wondrous, happening for all time.  
The moon's effects on the earth, tides of the sea are a never-ending paradigm.  
  
Hugs and tears, fights and fears, the feelings of friendships change.  
Love brings us closer together, but hurt from an ally will estrange.  
Ups and downs, ins and outs; these are the battles we fight and the hills we climb.  
The heart loves and the pain hurts, tides of life are a never-ending paradigm.  
  
Covenant and sacrifice, sin and vice, our faith can be unstable.  
It is up to us to choose whether or not we join Him at the table.  
Confess and repent, mercy and understanding; our Lord's love is sublime.  
Prayer and penance, fall and atonement, tides of faith are a never-ending paradigm.
