# What I Need

What I need is to get out of here.  
This room is drafty, miserable and cold.  
The end of my sentence is not near.  
When will I be brought into the fold?  

What I need is not to feel alone.  
It feels like I have been stuck here forever.  
I am trapped here with thoughts of my own.  
How much more of this must I endeavour?  

What I need is to know is what I've done wrong.  
How many sins have I committed against You?  
Time stands still, it has been so long.  
Where do I stand in this never ending queue?  

What I need is to be released from this prison.  
The jailer and the prisoner are one.  
When is it that I will earn admission?  
Life as I know it must be undone.  

What I need is to open my heart.  
My life on heaven and earth can not be the same.  
I draw the line, this is where it starts.  
This heart and soul are Yours to reclaim!  

What I need is to put You first.  
Nothing else matters besides You anymore.  
All of my ties to vanity, pride, and ego have dispersed.  
On my knees, to you, my oath is swore.  

What I need is to rewrite my story.  
Holy Spirit, I ask that it is my soul you save.
Jesus, please release me from this purgatory.
Lord God, Your love for me is all that I crave!
